  abstract  = {Access control is a crucial part of a system's security, restricting what actions users can perform on resources. Therefore, access control is a core component when dealing with e-Health data and resources, discriminating which is available for a certain party. We consider that current systems that attempt to assure the share of policies between facilities are mostly centralized, being prone to system's and network's faults and do not assure the integrity of policies lifecycle. Using a blockchain as store system for access policies we are able to ensure that the different entities have knowledge about the policies in place while maintaining a record of all permission requests, thus assuring integrity, auditability and authenticity.},
